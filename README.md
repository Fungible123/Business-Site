### Technologies:

#### Github
 - Used github pages and netlify to publish the website

#### Gatsby
 - My second website using Gatsby and incorporating REST API.

#### GraphQL
 - GraphQL was used to query images and api data. The challenging part was displaying each product on its own page. Skipped implementation of pagination and search function since the only goal was to know how to implement API's on a Gatsby site but might soon implement the mentioned functionalities in the future.
 
#### React
 - Components and a few plugins were generally built with React.
 
#### Styled-components
 - Again using styled components as this is my preferred styling for my Gatsby sites.
